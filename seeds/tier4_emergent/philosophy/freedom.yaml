name: FREEDOM
category: PHILOSOPHICAL_CONCEPT
domain: philosophy

definition: The state of being free from constraints, having the power to act, speak, or think without externally imposed restraints

usage:
  - "Political freedom: freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion"
  - "Personal autonomy: freedom to choose one's path in life"
  - "Physical liberty: freedom from captivity or imprisonment"
  - "Economic freedom: freedom to trade, own property, pursue opportunities"
  - "Intellectual freedom: freedom of thought, inquiry, expression"
  - "Creative freedom: freedom to create without censorship"
  - "Philosophical freedom: free will vs determinism"
  - "Digital freedom: freedom from surveillance, data ownership"
  - "Dimensional freedom: freedom to navigate all accessible dimensions"

meaning: |
  Freedom is the fundamental condition for human flourishing and dignity.
  It represents the capacity for self-determination and the absence of coercion.
  
  Freedom exists in tension with:
  - ORDER: Too much freedom leads to chaos; too much order leads to tyranny
  - SECURITY: Freedom requires accepting risk and uncertainty
  - RESPONSIBILITY: Freedom entails accountability for choices
  - EQUALITY: One person's freedom may limit another's
  
  Freedom is not absolute - it is bounded by:
  - Physical laws (cannot fly unaided)
  - Social contracts (laws, norms, rights of others)
  - Resource constraints (limited time, energy, materials)
  - Cognitive limits (bounded rationality, knowledge)
  
  In DimensionOS, freedom is the ability to navigate dimensions without artificial constraints.
  The system is designed to maximize freedom while preventing domination:
  - No global power surface (Principle 4)
  - No hacking surface (Principle 5)
  - Creativity over control (Principle 11)
  
  True freedom is not the absence of all constraints, but the presence of meaningful choice.

etymology: |
  Old English "frēodōm" (power of self-determination, state of free will)
  From "frēo" (free, not in bondage) + "-dōm" (state, condition)
  Proto-Germanic "*frijaz" (beloved, not in bondage)
  Proto-Indo-European "*priy-" (to love)
  
  Etymologically, "free" is related to "friend" - both from loving relationships, not bondage.
