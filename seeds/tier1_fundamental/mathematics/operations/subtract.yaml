name: SUBTRACT
category: MATHEMATICAL_OPERATION
domain: mathematics

definition: Contract magnitude within a dimension without changing structure

usage:
  - "Contract within dimension: 8 - 3 = 5"
  - "Remove quantities: 15 apples - 5 apples = 10 apples"
  - "Calculate difference: final - initial"
  - "Decrement: count - 1"
  - "Reduce: shrink magnitude at same dimensional level"
  - "Remove fuel from engine"
  - "Calculate change: new_value - old_value"
  - "Find remainder: total - used"

meaning: |
  Subtraction is the fundamental act of contracting magnitude within a dimension.
  It is REDUCTION without structural change.
  
  In DimensionOS, subtraction is an INTRA-DIMENSIONAL operator.
  When you subtract, you stay at the SAME dimensional level - you just contract magnitude.
  
  Subtraction is like:
  - Removing gas from an engine (less fuel, same engine)
  - Removing rubber from a tire (less material, same tire)
  - Removing water from a glass (less volume, same glass)
  
  Subtraction does NOT:
  - Create new dimensions (that's division)
  - Change dimensional structure (that's cross-dimensional)
  - Collapse dimensions (that's multiplication)
  
  Subtraction ONLY:
  - Contracts magnitude within current dimension
  - Preserves dimensional level
  - Maintains structure
  
  This is the philosophy: "Sometimes points are just points if we do not go deeper."
  Subtraction works with points at the current level without going deeper.

etymology: |
  From Latin "subtrahere" meaning "to draw from below, to take away"
  From "sub-" (from below) + "trahere" (to draw)

counterexamples:
  - wrong: "Subtraction creates new dimensions"
    correct: "Subtraction contracts within current dimension (division creates dimensions)"
    explanation: "Subtraction is intra-dimensional, not cross-dimensional"
  
  - wrong: "Subtraction changes structure"
    correct: "Subtraction preserves structure, only changes magnitude"
    explanation: "Structure changes require cross-dimensional operators"
  
  - wrong: "Subtraction always makes things smaller"
    correct: "Subtracting negative numbers makes things larger (10 - (-5) = 15)"
    explanation: "Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding a positive"
