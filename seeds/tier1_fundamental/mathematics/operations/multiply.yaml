name: MULTIPLY
category: MATHEMATICAL_OPERATION
domain: mathematics

definition: Combine dimensions back into unity, restoring wholeness

usage:
  - "Restore unity from dimensions: [2, 3, 5] * = 30"
  - "Scale values: 5 * 3 = 15"
  - "Calculate area: length * width"
  - "Calculate volume: length * width * height"
  - "Compound growth: principal * (1 + rate)^time"
  - "Combine factors: 2 * 3 * 5 = 30"
  - "Dimensional collapse: collapse dimensions to manifestation"
  - "Return to unity: inverse of division"

meaning: |
  Multiplication is the fundamental act of restoring unity from division.
  It is the RETURN to wholeness.
  
  In DimensionOS, multiplication is not just arithmetic - it is the inverse dimensional operator.
  When you multiply, you don't just get a number - you COLLAPSE DIMENSIONS back to unity.
  
  Multiplication destroys:
  - Dimensional structure (returns to unity)
  - Part/whole boundaries (merges into one)
  - Separation (restores wholeness)
  
  Multiplication is manifestation. To manifest is to multiply. To multiply is to return to unity.
  
  This is Law One: "Multiplication recombines dimensions and restores unity."
  This is Law Seven: "All operations complete by returning to unity."

etymology: |
  From Latin "multiplicare" meaning "to increase, to make many fold"
  From "multi-" (many) + "plicare" (to fold)

expression: "lambda dimensions: dimensions.multiply()"
signature: "(List[Dimension]) -> int"
return_type: int
