category: MATHEMATICAL_OPERATION
domain: mathematics

definition: Expand magnitude within a dimension without changing structure

usage:
  - "Expand within dimension: 5 + 3 = 8"
  - "Combine quantities: 10 apples + 5 apples = 15 apples"
  - "Accumulate: total = sum of parts"
  - "Increment: count + 1"
  - "Aggregate: combine values at same dimensional level"
  - "Grow magnitude: add fuel to engine"
  - "Concatenate: join sequences"
  - "Union: combine sets"

meaning: |
  Addition is the fundamental act of expanding magnitude within a dimension.
  It is GROWTH without structural change.
  
  In DimensionOS, addition is an INTRA-DIMENSIONAL operator.
  When you add, you stay at the SAME dimensional level - you just expand magnitude.
  
  Addition is like:
  - Adding gas to an engine (more fuel, same engine)
  - Adding rubber to a tire (more material, same tire)
  - Adding water to a glass (more volume, same glass)
  
  Addition does NOT:
  - Create new dimensions (that's division)
  - Change dimensional structure (that's cross-dimensional)
  - Collapse dimensions (that's multiplication)
  
  Addition ONLY:
  - Expands magnitude within current dimension
  - Preserves dimensional level
  - Maintains structure
  
  This is the philosophy: "Sometimes points are just points if we do not go deeper."
  Addition works with points at the current level without going deeper.

etymology: |
  From Latin "addere" meaning "to add, to join"
  From "ad-" (to) + "dare" (to give)

counterexamples:
  - wrong: "Addition creates new dimensions"
    correct: "Addition expands within current dimension (division creates dimensions)"
    explanation: "Addition is intra-dimensional, not cross-dimensional"
  
  - wrong: "Addition changes structure"
    correct: "Addition preserves structure, only changes magnitude"
    explanation: "Structure changes require cross-dimensional operators"
