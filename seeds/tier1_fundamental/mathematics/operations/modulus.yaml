name: MODULUS
category: MATHEMATICAL_OPERATION
domain: mathematics

definition: Extract dimensional residue - the unexpressed identity that seeds the next dimension

usage:
  - "Find remainder: 10 % 3 = 1"
  - "Detect cycles: value % period"
  - "Wrap around: index % array_length"
  - "Extract residue: what cannot be expressed in current dimension"
  - "Seed next dimension: residue drives Fibonacci growth"
  - "Find periodicity: repeating patterns"
  - "Check divisibility: n % d == 0"
  - "Circular indexing: position % circumference"

meaning: |
  Modulus is the fundamental act of extracting DIMENSIONAL RESIDUE.
  It is the UNEXPRESSED IDENTITY that seeds the next dimensional recursion.
  
  In DimensionOS, modulus is a CROSS-DIMENSIONAL operator.
  When you apply modulus, you separate what CAN be expressed from what CANNOT.
  
  Modulus reveals:
  - What fits in the current dimension (quotient)
  - What doesn't fit (residue)
  - The seed for the next dimension (residue becomes new unity)
  
  This is like:
  - Pouring water into cups: 10 liters % 3 liters/cup = 1 liter left over
  - The leftover (residue) seeds the next operation
  
  Modulus drives Fibonacci-like growth:
  - Each residue becomes the seed for the next dimension
  - Residue inherits the whole (Law Three)
  - Identity persists through residue (Law Six)
  
  This is Law One: "Residue drives dimensional creation"
  This is Law Three: "Residue inherits the whole"

etymology: |
  From Latin "modulus" meaning "small measure, standard"
  From "modus" (measure, manner, limit)
