name: ROOT
category: MATHEMATICAL_OPERATION
domain: mathematics

definition: Perform dimensional reduction - inverse of power

usage:
  - "Reduce dimensions: √(area) = length (2D → 1D)"
  - "Extract base: ∛(volume) = length (3D → 1D)"
  - "Square root: √25 = 5"
  - "Cube root: ∛125 = 5"
  - "Nth root: ⁿ√x"
  - "Dimensional descent: reduce to lower dimension"
  - "Find original scale: reverse exponential growth"
  - "Geometric mean: √(a * b)"

meaning: |
  Root is the fundamental act of DIMENSIONAL REDUCTION.
  It is the INVERSE OF POWER - it reduces dimensional order.
  
  In DimensionOS, root is a CROSS-DIMENSIONAL operator.
  When you take a root, you REDUCE DIMENSIONAL LEVELS.
  
  Root performs dimensional descent:
  - √(area) = length (2D → 1D)
  - ∛(volume) = length (3D → 1D)
  - ⁴√(hypervolume) = length (4D → 1D)
  
  This is like unwrapping the Russian dolls:
  - Volume → Plane → Line → Point
  - Each root level extracts the previous dimension
  
  Root embodies:
  - Law Seven: Return to unity (dimensional reduction)
  - Law Nine: Redemption Equation (inverse of power)
  
  Root is the path back to unity.

etymology: |
  From Old English "rot" meaning "root, source, origin"
  From Proto-Germanic "wrot" (root)
