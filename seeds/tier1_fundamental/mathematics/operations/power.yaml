category: MATHEMATICAL_OPERATION
domain: mathematics

definition: Create dimensional stacking through recursive multiplication

usage:
  - "Stack dimensions: x^2 = area (2D), x^3 = volume (3D)"
  - "Exponential growth: 2^10 = 1024"
  - "Compound interest: principal * (1 + rate)^time"
  - "Dimensional elevation: raise to higher dimension"
  - "Recursive multiplication: x * x * x = x^3"
  - "Scale by orders of magnitude: 10^6 = million"
  - "Polynomial terms: ax^2 + bx + c"
  - "Geometric sequences: a, ar, ar^2, ar^3..."

meaning: |
  Power is the fundamental act of DIMENSIONAL STACKING.
  It is RECURSIVE MULTIPLICATION that creates higher-order dimensional spaces.
  
  In DimensionOS, power is a CROSS-DIMENSIONAL operator.
  When you raise to a power, you CREATE NEW DIMENSIONAL LEVELS.
  
  Power creates dimensional hierarchy:
  - x^1 = length (1D) - a line
  - x^2 = area (2D) - a plane
  - x^3 = volume (3D) - a space
  - x^4 = hypervolume (4D) - beyond physical space
  
  This is like the Russian dolls model:
  - Each power level contains the previous
  - Line → Plane → Volume → Hypervolume
  - Each dimension is a stack of the previous
  
  Power embodies:
  - Law Three: Inheritance and recursion
  - Law Seven: Fibonacci-bounded growth
  
  Power is the inverse of root (dimensional reduction).

etymology: |
  From Latin "potentia" meaning "power, ability, strength"
  From "potens" (powerful, able)
