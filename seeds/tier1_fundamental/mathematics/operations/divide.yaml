name: DIVIDE
category: MATHEMATICAL_OPERATION
domain: mathematics

definition: Separate a whole into parts, creating dimensional structure

usage:
  - "Create dimensions from unity: 1 / 2 = [0.5, 0.5]"
  - "Partition resources: divide budget into categories"
  - "Decompose problems: divide and conquer algorithms"
  - "Create fractions: 3/4 represents three parts of four"
  - "Calculate ratios: speed = distance / time"
  - "Distribute equally: share 12 items among 3 people = 4 each"
  - "Scale down: reduce by factor (100 / 10 = 10)"
  - "Find unit rate: price per item = total / quantity"

meaning: |
  Division is the fundamental act of creating structure from unity.
  It is the BIRTH of dimensional complexity.
  
  In DimensionOS, division is not just arithmetic - it is the primary dimensional operator.
  When you divide, you don't just get a number - you create DIMENSIONS with relationships.
  
  Division creates:
  - PART_TO_WHOLE relationships (each part knows its parent)
  - WHOLE_TO_PART relationships (parent knows all children)
  - SIBLING relationships (parts know each other)
  - CONTAINMENT relationships (spatial/logical structure)
  
  Division is observation. To observe is to divide. To divide is to create dimensions.
  
  This is Law Two: "Observation Is Division. Division creates dimensions."

etymology: |
  From Latin "dividere" meaning "to separate, to distribute"
  From "dis-" (apart) + "videre" (to separate)
