name: E
category: MATHEMATICAL_CONSTANT
domain: mathematics

definition: The base of the natural logarithm, approximately 2.71828, representing continuous growth

usage:
  - "Exponential growth: population = P₀ × e^(rt)"
  - "Compound interest: A = P × e^(rt) (continuous compounding)"
  - "Decay processes: N(t) = N₀ × e^(-λt)"
  - "Normal distribution: probability density involves e^(-x²/2)"
  - "Euler's identity: e^(iπ) + 1 = 0"
  - "Calculus: derivative of e^x is e^x"
  - "Complex numbers: e^(ix) = cos(x) + i×sin(x)"
  - "Natural logarithm: ln(e) = 1"

meaning: |
  e is the mathematical constant of CONTINUOUS GROWTH and CHANGE.
  
  While π relates to circles and cycles, e relates to growth and transformation.
  e emerges naturally whenever you have:
  - Continuous compounding
  - Exponential growth or decay
  - Rates of change that depend on current value
  
  e is the answer to: "What number, when raised to the power of its own derivative, equals itself?"
  The function f(x) = e^x is its own derivative: d/dx(e^x) = e^x
  
  This makes e fundamental to calculus and differential equations.
  
  In DimensionOS, e represents the natural rate of dimensional expansion.
  When dimensions grow continuously (not in discrete steps), they grow at rate e.
  
  e connects to π through Euler's identity: e^(iπ) + 1 = 0
  This equation unites the five most important constants: e, i, π, 1, 0

etymology: |
  Named after Leonhard Euler, who extensively studied it in the 1720s.
  First calculated by Jacob Bernoulli in 1683 while studying compound interest.
  Euler proved it was irrational in 1737.
  Hermite proved it was transcendental in 1873.
