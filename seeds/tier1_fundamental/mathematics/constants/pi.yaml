meaning: |
  π represents the fundamental relationship between linear and circular dimensions.
  It is the bridge between straight lines and curves, between Euclidean and circular geometry.
  
  π appears throughout mathematics and physics not by coincidence, but because it encodes
  the deep structure of space itself. Wherever there is rotation, oscillation, or periodicity,
  π emerges naturally.
  
  As an irrational and transcendental number, π cannot be expressed as a simple fraction
  or as the root of any polynomial equation. It represents infinite complexity arising
  from perfect geometric simplicity.
  
  In DimensionOS, π is the constant that relates linear division to circular recursion.

etymology: |
  Greek letter π (pi), first letter of Greek word "periphery" (περιφέρεια).
  First used by Welsh mathematician William Jones in 1706.
  Popularized by Leonhard Euler in 1737.
