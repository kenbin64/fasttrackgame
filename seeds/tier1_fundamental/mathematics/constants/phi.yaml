category: MATHEMATICAL_CONSTANT
domain: mathematics

definition: The golden ratio, approximately 1.618, representing the most aesthetically pleasing proportion

usage:
  - "Golden rectangle: ratio of length to width = φ"
  - "Fibonacci sequence: ratio of consecutive terms approaches φ"
  - "Pentagram: ratios of segments equal φ"
  - "Architecture: Parthenon proportions use φ"
  - "Art: Renaissance paintings use golden ratio"
  - "Nature: spiral shells, flower petals, tree branches"
  - "Human body: ratios of body segments approximate φ"
  - "DimensionOS: natural limiter of recursive division"

meaning: |
  φ (phi) is the GOLDEN RATIO, the proportion that appears throughout nature, art, and mathematics.
  
  φ is defined as the ratio where:
  (a + b) / a = a / b = φ
  
  This creates a self-similar proportion: the whole is to the larger part
  as the larger part is to the smaller part.
  
  φ has unique mathematical properties:
  - φ² = φ + 1 (only positive number where square = itself + 1)
  - 1/φ = φ - 1 (reciprocal = itself - 1)
  - φ = (1 + √5) / 2
  
  φ appears in:
  - FIBONACCI SEQUENCE: lim(F(n+1)/F(n)) = φ
  - PENTAGONS: diagonal/side = φ
  - LOGARITHMIC SPIRALS: growth rate = φ
  - FRACTALS: self-similar scaling = φ
  
  In DimensionOS, φ is the NATURAL LIMITER of recursive division.
  When you divide recursively following the golden ratio, you create
  the Fibonacci dimensional structure: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
  
  φ embodies Law One: "Division generates dimensions and follows the Fibonacci spiral"

etymology: |
  Greek letter φ (phi), named after Greek sculptor Phidias (5th century BC)
  who used the golden ratio in the Parthenon.
  
  Also called:
  - Golden ratio
  - Golden mean
  - Golden section
  - Divine proportion (Luca Pacioli, 1509)
