name: SIBLING
category: relationship
tier: 1
domain: dimensional_relationships

# ============================================================================
# DEFINITION
# ============================================================================
definition: |
  SIBLING is the fundamental relationship where two parts share the same whole.
  It represents the lateral connection in the dimensional hierarchy - between 
  components at the same level.
  
  PHILOSOPHY:
  This relationship embodies Law Four (Connection Creates Meaning): "Dimensions 
  relate through connection. Connection creates meaning." Siblings are peers 
  that share context and can interact as equals.
  
  MATHEMATICAL NATURE:
  If W = whole and P₁, P₂ = parts, then:
  SIBLING(P₁, P₂) ⟺ PART_TO_WHOLE(P₁) = PART_TO_WHOLE(P₂) = W
  The relationship is bidirectional: P₁ ⟷ P₂
  
  DIMENSIONAL NATURE:
  - Points on the same line are SIBLINGS
  - Lines in the same plane are SIBLINGS
  - Planes in the same volume are SIBLINGS
  - Components at the same dimensional level sharing a parent are SIBLINGS

# ============================================================================
# USAGE
# ============================================================================
usage: |
  SIBLING is used to:
  1. Navigate between peers at the same level
  2. Find related components with shared context
  3. Establish equality and peer relationships
  4. Enable lateral communication
  5. Discover related parts of a whole
  
  INVOCATION:
  relationship = create_relationship(
      rel_type="SIBLING",
      source=part1_substrate,
      target=part2_substrate,
      bidirectional=True  # Siblings are mutual
  )

# ============================================================================
# MEANING
# ============================================================================
meaning: |
  SIBLING represents EQUALITY and SHARED CONTEXT.
  
  Siblings are peers that share the same parent/whole. They exist at the same 
  dimensional level and share the same context. Like cells in the same organ, 
  wheels on the same car, words in the same sentence.
  
  This relationship answers: "Who shares my context?" "Who are my peers?"
  
  PHILOSOPHICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
  - Equality through shared parentage
  - Context through common whole
  - Interaction between peers
  - Collaboration at the same level

  notes: |
    SIBLING is a derived relationship - it can be computed from PART_TO_WHOLE 
    relationships. Two substrates are siblings if they share the same 
    PART_TO_WHOLE target (same parent/whole).
