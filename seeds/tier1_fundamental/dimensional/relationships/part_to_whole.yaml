# ============================================================================
# DEFINITION
# ============================================================================
definition: |
  PART_TO_WHOLE is the fundamental relationship where a component relates to 
  its containing whole. It represents the upward connection in the dimensional 
  hierarchy - from the part to the system that contains it.
  
  PHILOSOPHY:
  This relationship embodies Law Three (Inheritance and Recursion): "Every 
  division inherits the whole." The part knows its whole, and through this 
  connection, inherits the pattern of the whole.
  
  MATHEMATICAL NATURE:
  If W = whole and P = part, then PART_TO_WHOLE(P) → W
  The relationship is directional: P ⟶ W
  
  DIMENSIONAL NATURE:
  - A point is PART_TO_WHOLE a line
  - A line is PART_TO_WHOLE a plane
  - A plane is PART_TO_WHOLE a volume
  - Each dimension is PART_TO_WHOLE the next higher dimension

# ============================================================================
# USAGE
# ============================================================================
usage: |
  PART_TO_WHOLE is used to:
  1. Navigate from component to container
  2. Access inherited properties from the whole
  3. Understand context and containment
  4. Trace dimensional hierarchy upward
  5. Establish ownership and belonging
  
  INVOCATION:
  relationship = create_relationship(
      rel_type="PART_TO_WHOLE",
      source=part_substrate,
      target=whole_substrate,
      bidirectional=False
  )

# ============================================================================
# MEANING
# ============================================================================
meaning: |
  PART_TO_WHOLE represents BELONGING and INHERITANCE.
  
  The part belongs to the whole and inherits its nature. Like a cell belongs 
  to an organ, a wheel belongs to a car, a word belongs to a sentence.
  
  This relationship answers: "What contains me?" "What am I part of?"
  
  PHILOSOPHICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
  - Identity through containment
  - Context through belonging
  - Inheritance through connection
  - Meaning through relationship to the larger whole
