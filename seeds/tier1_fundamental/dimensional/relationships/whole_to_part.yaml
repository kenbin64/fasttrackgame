# ============================================================================
# DEFINITION
# ============================================================================
definition: |
  WHOLE_TO_PART is the fundamental relationship where a whole relates to its 
  constituent parts. It represents the downward connection in the dimensional 
  hierarchy - from the system to its components.
  
  PHILOSOPHY:
  This relationship embodies Law Two (Observation Is Division): "Division 
  creates dimensions." The whole divides into parts, and through this 
  relationship, the whole knows its components.
  
  MATHEMATICAL NATURE:
  If W = whole and P = part, then WHOLE_TO_PART(W) → {P₁, P₂, ..., Pₙ}
  The relationship is directional: W ⟶ P
  One whole can have many parts (one-to-many)
  
  DIMENSIONAL NATURE:
  - A line has WHOLE_TO_PART relationship with its points
  - A plane has WHOLE_TO_PART relationship with its lines
  - A volume has WHOLE_TO_PART relationship with its planes
  - Each dimension has WHOLE_TO_PART relationship with lower dimensions

# ============================================================================
# USAGE
# ============================================================================
usage: |
  WHOLE_TO_PART is used to:
  1. Navigate from container to components
  2. Enumerate parts of a whole
  3. Perform division operations
  4. Trace dimensional hierarchy downward
  5. Understand composition and structure
  
  INVOCATION:
  relationship = create_relationship(
      rel_type="WHOLE_TO_PART",
      source=whole_substrate,
      target=part_substrate,
      bidirectional=False
  )

# ============================================================================
# MEANING
# ============================================================================
meaning: |
  WHOLE_TO_PART represents COMPOSITION and DIVISION.
  
  The whole is composed of parts and can be divided into them. Like an organ 
  is composed of cells, a car is composed of wheels, a sentence is composed 
  of words.
  
  This relationship answers: "What am I made of?" "What are my components?"
  
  PHILOSOPHICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
  - Structure through composition
  - Understanding through division
  - Complexity through parts
  - Analysis through decomposition
