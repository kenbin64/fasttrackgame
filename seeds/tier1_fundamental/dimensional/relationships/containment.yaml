# DEFINITION
# ============================================================================
definition: |
  CONTAINMENT is the fundamental relationship where one substrate exists within 
  the boundaries of another. It represents spatial or logical inclusion - the 
  contained substrate is fully enclosed by the container.
  
  PHILOSOPHY:
  This relationship embodies the Russian Dolls principle: each dimension 
  contains the previous. CONTAINMENT is the spatial manifestation of 
  dimensional hierarchy.
  
  MATHEMATICAL NATURE:
  If C = container and E = element, then CONTAINMENT(E, C) means:
  - E ⊆ C (E is a subset of C)
  - All points of E are within the boundaries of C
  - The relationship is directional: E ⟶ C
  
  DIMENSIONAL NATURE:
  - A point is CONTAINED by a line (0D ⊂ 1D)
  - A line is CONTAINED by a plane (1D ⊂ 2D)
  - A plane is CONTAINED by a volume (2D ⊂ 3D)
  - Each dimension is CONTAINED by higher dimensions

# ============================================================================
# USAGE
# ============================================================================
usage: |
  CONTAINMENT is used to:
  1. Establish spatial or logical boundaries
  2. Determine if an element is within a region
  3. Navigate from contained to container
  4. Enforce dimensional constraints
  5. Understand scope and boundaries
  
  INVOCATION:
  relationship = create_relationship(
      rel_type="CONTAINMENT",
      source=element_substrate,
      target=container_substrate,
      bidirectional=False
  )

# ============================================================================
# MEANING
# ============================================================================
meaning: |
  CONTAINMENT represents BOUNDARIES and SCOPE.
  
  The contained element exists within the boundaries of the container. The 
  container defines the scope and limits of the contained. Like a point on a 
  line, a file in a folder, a thought in a mind.
  
  This relationship answers: "What contains me?" "What are my boundaries?"
  
  PHILOSOPHICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
  - Boundaries through containment
  - Scope through enclosure
  - Protection through boundaries
  - Context through spatial relationship

  notes: |
    CONTAINMENT differs from PART_TO_WHOLE:
    - PART_TO_WHOLE: Component relationship (wheel is PART of car)
    - CONTAINMENT: Spatial/logical inclusion (point is CONTAINED by line)
    
    A part may not be spatially contained (wheel is outside car body),
    but a contained element is always within boundaries.
