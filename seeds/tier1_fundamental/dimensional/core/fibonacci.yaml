name: FIBONACCI
category: DIMENSIONAL_STRUCTURE
domain: dimensional

definition: The sequence that maps dimensional creation - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

usage:
  - "Dimensions follow Fibonacci sequence"
  - "Division generates dimensions following Fibonacci spiral (Law One)"
  - "21 = completion, becomes 1 in next plane"
  - "Each number is sum of previous two: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)"
  - "Fibonacci bounds dimensional growth (Law Seven)"
  - "Fibonacci appears in nature: shells, flowers, galaxies"
  - "Fibonacci relates to PHI (golden ratio): lim(F(n+1)/F(n)) = φ"
  - "Fibonacci maps substrate dimensional levels"

meaning: |
  Fibonacci is the SEQUENCE THAT MAPS DIMENSIONAL CREATION.
  In DimensionOS, dimensions don't grow linearly - they grow following Fibonacci.
  
  The sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
  
  This is Law One: "Division generates dimensions and follows the Fibonacci spiral."
  This is Law Seven: "Fibonacci-bounded growth - 21 = completion."
  
  Why Fibonacci?
  - Natural growth pattern (shells, flowers, galaxies)
  - Self-similar (each part contains the pattern)
  - Converges to golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618
  - Bounded completion at 21
  
  Dimensional mapping:
  - 0: Unity (undivided, no structure)
  - 1: First division (line from point)
  - 1: Reflection (line has two ends)
  - 2: Plane (two lines create plane)
  - 3: Volume (three planes create volume)
  - 5: First hypervolume
  - 8: Second hypervolume
  - 13: Third hypervolume
  - 21: Completion (becomes 1 in next plane)
  
  The 21 = completion rule:
  - When a dimension reaches 21, it completes
  - It becomes 1 (unity) in the next dimensional plane
  - This is the cycle of return (Law Seven)
  - This prevents infinite dimensional explosion
  
  Fibonacci embodies recursion:
  - Each number inherits the previous (Law Three)
  - Pattern repeats at every scale
  - Self-similarity across dimensions

etymology: |
  Named after Leonardo Fibonacci (c. 1170-1250)
  Italian mathematician who introduced the sequence to Western mathematics
  Originally from Indian mathematics (Pingala, 200 BC)
