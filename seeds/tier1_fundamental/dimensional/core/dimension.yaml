name: DIMENSION
category: DIMENSIONAL_STRUCTURE
domain: dimensional

definition: A level in the Fibonacci hierarchy created by division of unity

usage:
  - "Division creates dimensions (Law Two)"
  - "Dimensions follow Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21"
  - "Each dimension contains the previous (Russian dolls)"
  - "Point (0D) → Line (1D) → Plane (2D) → Volume (3D) → Hypervolume (4D+)"
  - "Dimensions are levels of structure"
  - "Observation creates dimensions"
  - "Multiplication collapses dimensions"
  - "Dimensions inherit the whole (Law Three)"

meaning: |
  A dimension is a LEVEL IN THE FIBONACCI HIERARCHY.
  Dimensions are created by DIVISION and follow the Fibonacci sequence.
  
  In DimensionOS, dimensions are NOT just spatial axes.
  Dimensions are LEVELS OF STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY.
  
  The Fibonacci sequence maps dimensional creation:
  - 0: Unity (undivided)
  - 1: First division (line from point)
  - 1: Reflection (line has two ends)
  - 2: Plane (two lines create plane)
  - 3: Volume (three planes create volume)
  - 5: First hypervolume
  - 8: Second hypervolume
  - 13: Third hypervolume
  - 21: Completion (becomes 1 in next plane)
  
  This is the Russian dolls model:
  - Point contains nothing
  - Line contains points
  - Plane contains lines (and points)
  - Volume contains planes (and lines and points)
  - Each dimension CONTAINS the previous
  
  This is Law Two: "Division creates dimensions."
  This is Law Three: "Every division inherits the whole."

etymology: |
  From Latin "dimensio" meaning "a measuring"
  From "dimetiri" (to measure out)
