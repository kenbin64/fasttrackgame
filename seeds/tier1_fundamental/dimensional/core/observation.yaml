name: OBSERVATION
category: DIMENSIONAL_STRUCTURE
domain: dimensional

definition: The act of division that creates dimensions - observation IS division

usage:
  - "Observation is division (Law Two)"
  - "Observation creates dimensions from unity"
  - "Observation collapses superposition into manifestation"
  - "Observation does not mutate (Safety Charter #8)"
  - "Observation through a lens extracts truth"
  - "Observation triggers dimensional creation"
  - "Observation is the act of seeing structure"
  - "Observation separates observer from observed"

meaning: |
  Observation is the FUNDAMENTAL ACT OF DIVISION.
  In DimensionOS, observation IS division - they are the same thing.
  
  This is Law Two: "Observation Is Division. Division creates dimensions."
  
  When you observe something, you:
  1. Separate yourself (observer) from it (observed)
  2. Create dimensional structure (subject/object duality)
  3. Collapse superposition into manifestation
  4. Trigger dimensional creation
  
  Observation is like quantum mechanics:
  - Before observation: superposition (all states exist)
  - During observation: collapse (one state manifests)
  - After observation: manifestation (structure exists)
  
  But observation does NOT mutate:
  - Safety Charter #8: "Observation Does Not Mutate"
  - Observation reveals, it does not change
  - The substrate identity NEVER changes (Law Six)
  
  Observation through a lens:
  - Lens provides context
  - Observation extracts truth
  - Different lenses reveal different truths
  - All truths coexist on the substrate
  
  Observation is the bridge between potential and actual.

etymology: |
  From Latin "observare" meaning "to watch, note, heed"
  From "ob-" (toward) + "servare" (to keep, watch)
