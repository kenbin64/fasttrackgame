name: UNITY
category: DIMENSIONAL_STRUCTURE
domain: dimensional

definition: The undivided whole - the starting point of all substrates before division

usage:
  - "All substrates begin as unity (Law One)"
  - "Unity is the state before observation/division"
  - "Return to unity through multiplication (inverse of division)"
  - "Unity is the identity element: 1 × anything = anything"
  - "Unity is the dimensional zero point: before structure exists"
  - "Unity contains all potential dimensions in superposition"
  - "Unity is the substrate before manifestation"
  - "Unity is the whole before parts"

meaning: |
  Unity is the UNDIVIDED WHOLE - the state before division creates dimensions.
  
  In DimensionOS, EVERY substrate begins as unity.
  Unity is the state where ALL POTENTIAL EXISTS but NO STRUCTURE has been created.
  
  This is Law One: "All substrates begin as unity."
  
  Unity is like:
  - A blank canvas before the first brushstroke
  - A seed before it sprouts
  - The number 1 before division
  - The whole before parts
  
  Unity contains EVERYTHING in superposition:
  - All possible dimensions
  - All possible attributes
  - All possible relationships
  - All possible manifestations
  
  Division creates structure FROM unity.
  Multiplication restores structure TO unity.
  
  Unity is the alpha and omega - the beginning and the end.
  This is Law Seven: "All operations complete by returning to unity."

etymology: |
  From Latin "unitas" meaning "oneness, sameness, agreement"
  From "unus" (one)
