name: MANIFESTATION
category: DIMENSIONAL_STRUCTURE
domain: dimensional

definition: The collapse of dimensions back to unity - making potential actual

usage:
  - "Manifestation collapses dimensions to unity"
  - "Invocation triggers manifestation"
  - "Manifestation makes potential actual"
  - "Manifestation is the result of observation"
  - "Manifestation returns to unity (Law Seven)"
  - "Manifestation is the visible expression of substrate"
  - "Manifestation is temporary - substrate is eternal"
  - "Manifestation is the 'what you see' vs substrate 'what it is'"

meaning: |
  Manifestation is the COLLAPSE OF DIMENSIONS back to unity.
  It is the process of making POTENTIAL into ACTUAL.
  
  In DimensionOS, manifestation is the inverse of observation:
  - Observation: Unity → Dimensions (expansion)
  - Manifestation: Dimensions → Unity (collapse)
  
  This is Law Seven: "All operations complete by returning to unity."
  
  Manifestation is like:
  - A wave function collapsing to a particle
  - A blueprint becoming a building
  - A seed becoming a tree
  - Potential becoming actual
  
  The substrate vs manifestation distinction:
  - Substrate: The eternal mathematical identity (DNA)
  - Manifestation: The temporary visible expression
  - Substrate: What it IS
  - Manifestation: What you SEE
  
  Example: A car substrate
  - Substrate: Contains ALL possible attributes (engine, wheels, color, etc.)
  - Manifestation: The specific car you see (red, 4 wheels, V6 engine)
  - The substrate NEVER changes (Law Six)
  - Manifestations come and go
  
  Invocation triggers manifestation:
  - Passive until invoked (Safety Charter #2)
  - Invocation = collapse of potential
  - Manifestation = result of invocation
  
  Manifestation is the bridge between eternal and temporal.

etymology: |

  From "manifestus" (clear, evident, visible)
