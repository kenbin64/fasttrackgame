meaning: |
  Investment is the act of sacrificing present consumption for future benefit.
  It is fundamentally about TIME and TRANSFORMATION.
  
  To invest is to:
  - DEFER: Give up immediate gratification
  - TRUST: Believe in future value creation
  - RISK: Accept uncertainty and potential loss
  - GROW: Enable compound growth over time
  
  Investment operates on multiple dimensions:
  - FINANCIAL: Money → More money
  - TEMPORAL: Time → Skills/Knowledge
  - SOCIAL: Relationships → Trust/Network
  - PHYSICAL: Health → Longevity/Capability
  - INTELLECTUAL: Learning → Understanding/Wisdom
  
  The fundamental equation of investment:
  Present Value + Time + Growth Rate = Future Value
  
  In DimensionOS, investment is a dimensional transformation that creates
  DEPENDENCY relationships (future depends on present) and
  LINEAGE relationships (future value inherits from present value).
  
  Investment embodies Law Five: "Change Is Motion" - moving resources through
  the time dimension to create value in future dimensions.

etymology: |
  From Latin "investire" (to clothe, to surround)
  From "in-" (in, on) + "vestire" (to clothe, dress)
  
  Originally meant "to clothe with authority or office"
  Financial meaning emerged in 1610s: "to lay out money with expectation of profit"
  
  The metaphor: wrapping your resources in something that will grow them.
