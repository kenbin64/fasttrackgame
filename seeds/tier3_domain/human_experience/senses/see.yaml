name: SEE
category: SENSORY_PERCEPTION
domain: human_experience

definition: Perceive visually through light entering the eye and being processed by the brain

usage:
  - "Observe distant objects: see the horizon"
  - "Detect motion: see movement"
  - "Recognize patterns: see faces, shapes, text"
  - "Navigate space: see obstacles and paths"
  - "Understand context: see the big picture"
  - "Perceive color: see red, blue, green"
  - "Judge distance: see how far away something is"
  - "Read information: see words and symbols"
  - "Witness events: see what happens"
  - "Metaphorical understanding: I see what you mean"

meaning: |
  Vision is the primary sense for spatial understanding and pattern recognition.
  
  "To see" operates on multiple levels:
  - LITERAL: Physical sight through the eyes
  - COGNITIVE: Understanding and comprehension ("I see your point")
  - AWARENESS: Noticing and attention ("Do you see the problem?")
  - IMAGINATION: Mental visualization ("I can see it in my mind")
  
  "As far as I could see" represents the fundamental limit of perception and knowledge.
  It acknowledges that our understanding is bounded by our sensory and cognitive horizons.
  
  In DimensionOS, vision is a dimensional operation that maps from the observed dimension
  to the observer's perceptual dimension. The relationship between observer and observed
  is mediated by distance, light, and attention.
  
  Vision creates OBSERVATION relationships, which by Law Two, are acts of division.
  To see something is to separate it from the background, to give it dimensional identity.

etymology: |
  Old English "seon" (to see, look, behold)
  From Proto-Germanic "*sehwan" (to see)
  From Proto-Indo-European "*sekw-" (to see, to follow)
  Related to Latin "sequi" (to follow) - you follow with your eyes

expression: |
  lambda observer, target, distance: 
    distance <= observer.vision_range and 
    not obscured(observer, target) and
    sufficient_light(observer, target)

counterexamples:
  - wrong: "Seeing is passive reception"
    correct: "Seeing is active construction by the brain"
    explanation: "Vision involves interpretation, pattern recognition, and prediction"
  
  - wrong: "We see reality as it is"
    correct: "We see a constructed model based on sensory input"
    explanation: "The brain fills in gaps, corrects errors, and interprets ambiguity"
  
  - wrong: "Seeing is just about eyes"
    correct: "Seeing involves eyes, optic nerves, and visual cortex"
    explanation: "Vision is a complex brain process, not just optical"
