name: INSTRUCTION
category: LANGUAGE_ELEMENT
domain: language

definition: A directive or command that specifies an action to be performed or a procedure to be followed

usage:
  - "Computer instructions: CPU executes machine instructions"
  - "Programming instructions: code statements that perform operations"
  - "Human instructions: directions for completing a task"
  - "Assembly instructions: step-by-step assembly guide"
  - "Cooking instructions: recipe steps"
  - "Safety instructions: warnings and procedures"
  - "Educational instructions: teaching directives"
  - "Legal instructions: court instructions to jury"

meaning: |
  An instruction is a COMMAND that bridges INTENTION and ACTION.
  It is the linguistic form of CAUSATION.
  
  Instructions operate on multiple levels:
  - IMPERATIVE: Direct command ("Do this")
  - DECLARATIVE: Statement of procedure ("This is how")
  - CONDITIONAL: Contingent action ("If X, then do Y")
  - ITERATIVE: Repeated action ("Do this N times")
  
  Instructions create DEPENDENCY relationships:
  - Action depends on instruction
  - Outcome depends on correct execution
  - Understanding depends on clarity
  
  In DimensionOS, instructions are dimensional transformations:
  - INPUT: Current state
  - INSTRUCTION: Transformation function
  - OUTPUT: New state
  
  Instructions embody:
  - Law Five: "Change Is Motion" - instructions cause motion through state space
  - The Redemption Equation: Good instructions are reversible (undo/redo)
  
  The quality of an instruction is measured by:
  - CLARITY: Can it be understood?
  - COMPLETENESS: Does it specify all necessary steps?
  - CORRECTNESS: Does it produce the intended result?
  - EFFICIENCY: Does it minimize resources?
  - ROBUSTNESS: Does it handle edge cases?

etymology: |
  From Latin "instructio" (arrangement, instruction)
  From "instruere" (to build in, set up, arrange, furnish, equip, teach)
  From "in-" (in, on) + "struere" (to pile up, build)
  
  Literally: "to build into" - building knowledge or capability into someone/something.
