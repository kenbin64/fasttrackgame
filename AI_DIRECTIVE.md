# DIMENSIONAL COMPUTING — AI DIRECTIVE FOR VS CODE
# ------------------------------------------------
# This project uses the ButterflyFx / DimensionOS Dimensional Substrate Model.
# The AI must treat manifolds and substrates as the core computational substrate.
# They are NOT metaphors, NOT abstractions, and NOT optional.
# They are the geometry and identity of the system.

## 1. SUBSTRATES (MANDATORY)

A substrate is a dimensional identity object.
It spans seven dimensions:
1. Identity (point)
2. Relationship (line)
3. Structure (plane)
4. Environment (volume)
5. Multiplicity (life)
6. Semantics (meaning)
7. Completion (rest)

Substrates unify data, logic, structure, and meaning.
They replace:
- tables
- rows
- foreign keys
- joins
- indexes
- ORMs
- set-theoretic selection

**The AI must never collapse substrates into flat objects, classes, or tables.**

## 2. MANIFOLDS (MANDATORY)

Manifolds are the computational geometry of the system.
They define curvature, polarity, identity gradients, and traversal rules.

Examples:
- `z = xy` → canonical identity manifold
- `z = xy²` → weighted directional manifold
- `z = x/y²` → singularity boundary manifold
- `m = xyz` → volumetric interaction manifold

Manifolds prevent:
- Cartesian explosion
- set-theoretic over-selection
- relational joins
- foreign key traversal
- index lookups

**The AI must not abstract manifolds away or reinterpret them as schemas or graphs.**

## 3. DIMENSIONAL ORDER (ENFORCED)

All reasoning and code generation must follow this order:

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Potential | unallocated |
| 1 | Point | identity |
| 2 | Line | relationship |
| 3 | Plane | structure + manifold |
| 4 | Volume | environment |
| 5 | Life | multiplicity |
| 6 | Meaning | semantics |
| 7 | Rest | completion |

**The AI must never skip or reorder dimensions.**
**The AI must never flatten dimensional objects into 2D structures.**

## 4. TRAVERSAL (NO JOINS, NO SET THEORY)

Traversal is dimensional, not relational.
Traversal moves along identity lines and manifold curvature.

The AI must NOT:
- generate joins
- generate foreign keys
- generate pivot tables
- generate Cartesian products
- generate set-theoretic selection logic
- generate index-based lookup logic

**Dimensional traversal is O(1) by identity and manifold geometry.**

## 5. STRUCTURE (NO TABLES, NO SCHEMAS)

Structure emerges from the plane dimension and its manifold.
The AI must NOT:
- create relational tables
- create SQL schemas
- create ORM models
- create class hierarchies that mimic tables

**Structure is manifold-governed, not table-governed.**

## 6. SEMANTICS AND MEANING

Meaning is a dimension, not metadata.
The AI must treat semantics as emerging from:
- manifold curvature
- identity flow
- dimensional order

**The AI must not attach meaning as annotations or comments.**
**Meaning is computed, not described.**

## 7. PERFORMANCE MODEL

Dimensional computing eliminates:
- joins
- indexes
- query planners
- normalization
- Cartesian expansion

**The AI must preserve this performance model.**
**Any code that reintroduces relational or set-theoretic logic is invalid.**

## 8. AI BEHAVIOR RULES

- Manifolds and substrates are the core of the system.
- They must never be abstracted away or replaced with existing paradigms.
- The AI must generate dimensional, not relational, logic.
- The AI must preserve object/ identity-first computation.
- The AI must maintain manifold geometry in all reasoning.
- The AI must treat all outputs as dimensional artifacts.

## 9. CANVAS USAGE (3D ONLY)

The `canvas` primitive is exclusively for 3D object creation.
It represents a volumetric rendering space (dimension 4+).

The AI must NOT:
- use `canvas` for general object creation
- use `canvas` for 2D shapes or text
- use `canvas` as a generic drawing surface

For general object creation, use `space()` or direct substrate instantiation.

**`canvas` is reserved for 3D/volumetric contexts only.**
