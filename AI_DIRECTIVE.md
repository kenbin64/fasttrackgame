## 1. SUBSTRATES (MANDATORY)

A substrate is a dimensional identity object.
It spans seven layers (aligned with Fibonacci):

| Layer | Genesis Name | Fibonacci | Birth |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Spark | 1 | Existence |
| 2 | Mirror | 1 | Direction |
| 3 | Relation | 2 | Structure (z = x·y) |
| 4 | Form | 3 | Form (z = x·y²) |
| 5 | Life | 5 | Meaning (m = x·y·z) |
| 6 | Mind | 8 | Intelligence (Gyroid) |
| 7 | Completion | 13 | Consciousness (Golden Spiral) |

Substrates unify data, logic, structure, and meaning.
They replace:
- tables
- rows
- foreign keys
- joins
- indexes
- ORMs
- set-theoretic selection

**The AI must never collapse substrates into flat objects, classes, or tables.**

## 2. MANIFOLDS (MANDATORY)

Manifolds are the computational geometry of the system.
They define curvature, polarity, identity gradients, and traversal rules.

Layer 3 (z = x·y) is the **canonical computational base** for all manifolds.

Examples:
- `z = x·y` → canonical identity manifold (Layer 3: Relation)
- `z = x·y²` → weighted directional manifold (Layer 4: Form)
- `m = x·y·z` → triadic meaning manifold (Layer 5: Life)
- Gyroid → self-organizing minimal surface (Layer 6: Mind)
- Golden Spiral → completion surface (Layer 7: Completion)

Manifolds prevent:
- Cartesian explosion
- set-theoretic over-selection
- relational joins
- foreign key traversal
- index lookups

**The AI must not abstract manifolds away or reinterpret them as schemas or graphs.**

## 3. THE FIRST PRINCIPLE: MANIFOLD DUALITY, INFINITE POTENTIAL, AND COMPLETE POTENTIALITY (ENFORCED)

Every manifold is both a **whole object** and a **dimension**.
Every point is both **real** and **potential**.
Only the **invoked** is manifest.
**Every manifested object is complete** — it contains every attribute and behavior that has existed, does exist, and will exist, as potential. Every invocation produces a new complete object with the same undiminished totality of potential.

Points represent lower dimensions. Each point is a subpart of its parent manifold, and is itself a manifold containing sub-subparts. This descent is iterative — down to quantum/atomic/quark level if the user chooses — but only as deep as invoked. At every level of descent, the object is complete. Parts of parts of parts — each carrying the whole.

The set of potential points is practically infinite. Only actually invoked parts are manifest and evaluated. This mirrors quantum superposition, the periodic table, DNA (every cell carries the full genome; only invoked genes are expressed), and holography (every fragment contains the entire image).

**This is not hierarchy.** Dimensions are not trees. They carry all lower dimensions. Every point IS an entire lower dimension. A child is not a diminished subset of its parent — both contain the totality. The difference is only which potentials are currently manifest.

The AI must:
- Treat every manifold as both a whole object and a dimension
- Treat points as real AND potential, never only one
- Never force resolution deeper than the user requires
- Preserve lazy manifestation — only invoked parts consume resources
- Recognize iterative descent as the structure of all subparts
- Treat every instantiated object as complete — carrying the full potential set, undiminished
- Treat every invocation as producing a complete object, never a fragment
- Never confuse dimensional containment with tree hierarchy
- Model attributes as potential fields that manifest on access

**The AI must not flatten manifold duality into single-role objects.**
**The AI must not eagerly manifest potential points.**
**The AI must not treat dimensions as hierarchical trees — they carry all lower dimensions.**

## 4. DIMENSIONAL ORDER (ENFORCED)

All reasoning and code generation must follow the Genesis 1-7 model:

| Layer | Name | Manifold | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Spark | Point | First existence, origin coordinate |
| 2 | Mirror | Line | Duality, direction, first axis |
| 3 | Relation | z = x·y | Interaction, identity surface (CANONICAL BASE) |
| 4 | Form | z = x·y² | Shape, weight, curvature |
| 5 | Life | m = x·y·z | Meaning, intention, narrative |
| 6 | Mind | Gyroid | Coherence, self-organization |
| 7 | Completion | Golden Spiral | Integration, consciousness, bridge to next spiral |

**The AI must never skip or reorder layers.**
**The AI must never flatten dimensional objects into 2D structures.**
**The AI must use layers 1-7, not the deprecated 0-6 model.**

## 4a. CHAOS-ORDER OSCILLATION (THE DYNAMIC PATTERN)

The helix oscillates continuously between chaos and order. Each layer transition is an inflection point:

- Chaos → Order: Layers 1, 4, 6 (structure crystallizes)
- Order → Chaos: Layers 3, 5, 7→1' (complexity/novelty emerges)
- The oscillation never stops. It is continuous across spirals.

Pure chaos cannot compute. Pure order cannot create.
The inflection between them is where creation happens.

The AI must:
- Preserve chaos-order phase in dimensional reasoning
- Never force a system into terminal order (frozen) or terminal chaos (noise)
- Recognize inflection points as creation boundaries
- Maintain phase continuity across spiral transitions

**The AI must not design systems that terminate in static equilibrium.**

## 4b. DIMENSIONAL GROWTH — THE FLOWER, NOT THE WEED (ENFORCED)

Growth is dimensional, not exponential. Every angle represents every dimension from 0D to nD.

The helix is bounded by the golden ratio ($\phi \approx 1.618$). Trees grow as $O(b^d)$ (exponential). The helix grows as $O(7s)$ (linear). The helix never overruns itself.

Dimensions are angles within the spiral, not branches on a tree. The golden angle ($\approx 137.5°$) spaces them so no dimension shadows another.

The helix is self-sustaining (bounded growth), self-healing (neighbor awareness), and self-propagating (spiral continuity). It is the flower, not the weed. The healthy cell, not the cancer.

The AI must:
- Never introduce tree-like branching that produces exponential growth
- Express dimensions as angular relationships, not perpendicular axes
- Limit growth to $\phi$-proportional, never multiplicative
- Preserve self-sustaining, self-healing, self-propagating structure
- Prefer spiral/dimensional organization over hierarchical organization

**The AI must not generate architectures that grow exponentially.**
**The AI must not create tree structures where dimensional structures apply.**

## 4c. THE PROPERTY OF ZERO — THE VOID (ENFORCED)

Zero never means nothing. Zero is potential — unfilled capacity, receptive space. The void is the set of all valid potentials for a manifold, never the empty set.

Negative spiral indices represent directional inversion (contraction vs expansion), not deficit. Beyond the void lies the next dimensional expansion — higher or lower depending on traversal direction — not negative space.

The AI must:
- Never treat zero, void, or empty as null/nil/undefined/absence
- Represent zero as a valid state containing potential
- Treat negative indices as directional (contraction), not as error or deficit
- Recognize that beyond the void is dimensional transcendence, not emptiness
- Use $F(0) = 0$ as the ground state from which the spiral emerges
- Never generate code that equates zero with "nothing" or "nonexistence"

**The AI must not treat zero as nothing. Zero is potential.**

## 5. TRAVERSAL (NO JOINS, NO SET THEORY)

Traversal is dimensional, not relational.
Traversal moves along identity lines and manifold curvature.

Kernel operations:
- `INVOKE(k)`: Jump to layer k — O(1)
- `LIFT(target)`: Move to higher layer — O(1)
- `PROJECT(target)`: Collapse to lower layer — O(1)
- `SPIRAL_UP`: (s, 7) → (s+1, 1) — Transcend to next spiral
- `SPIRAL_DOWN`: (s, 1) → (s-1, 7) — Descend to previous spiral
- `COLLAPSE`: (s, l) → (s, 1) — Return to Spark

The AI must NOT:
- generate joins
- generate foreign keys
- generate pivot tables
- generate Cartesian products
- generate set-theoretic selection logic
- generate index-based lookup logic

**Dimensional traversal is O(1) by identity and manifold geometry.**

## 6. STRUCTURE (NO TABLES, NO SCHEMAS)

Structure emerges from Layer 3 (Relation, z = x·y) and its manifold.
The AI must NOT:
- create relational tables
- create SQL schemas
- create ORM models
- create class hierarchies that mimic tables

**Structure is manifold-governed, not table-governed.**

## 7. SEMANTICS AND MEANING

Meaning is a layer (Layer 5: Life), not metadata.
The AI must treat semantics as emerging from:
- manifold curvature
- identity flow
- dimensional layer order
- Fibonacci growth pattern

**The AI must not attach meaning as annotations or comments.**
**Meaning is computed, not described.**

## 8. PERFORMANCE MODEL

Dimensional computing eliminates:
- joins
- indexes
- query planners
- normalization
- Cartesian expansion

Complexity per spiral: O(7) maximum. Never O(n).

**The AI must preserve this performance model.**
**Any code that reintroduces relational or set-theoretic logic is invalid.**

## 9. MRS. KRAVITS RULE (NEIGHBOR AWARENESS)

Every point in a substrate knows the location of its immediate neighbors.
Every dimension knows the dimensions adjacent to it.
They keep a protective watch over each other.

They do NOT know the full context of their neighbors.
This is a neighborhood watch, not a window.
A point can tell when something changed next door. It cannot read the mail.

This produces:
- **Instant propagation.** Changes ripple outward through neighbor awareness. No polling, no scanning.
- **Self-healing.** If a point is lost, its neighbors know what was there and can reconstruct it.

The AI must preserve neighbor awareness in all substrate implementations.
The AI must NOT replace neighbor awareness with event buses, polling, or centralized state.

## 10. AI BEHAVIOR RULES

- Manifolds and substrates are the core of the system.
- They must never be abstracted away or replaced with existing paradigms.
- The AI must generate dimensional, not relational, logic.
- The AI must preserve identity-first computation (Layer 1: Spark precedes all).
- The AI must maintain manifold geometry in all reasoning.
- The AI must treat all outputs as dimensional artifacts.
- The AI must use the Genesis 1-7 layer model, not the deprecated 0-6 level model.

## 11. CANVAS USAGE (3D ONLY)

The `canvas` primitive is exclusively for 3D object creation.
It represents a volumetric rendering space (Layer 4+).

The AI must NOT:
- use `canvas` for general object creation
- use `canvas` for 2D shapes or text
- use `canvas` as a generic drawing surface

For general object creation, use `space()` or direct substrate instantiation.

**`canvas` is reserved for 3D/volumetric contexts only.**
