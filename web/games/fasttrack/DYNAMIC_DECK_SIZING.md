# Dynamic Deck Sizing - Implementation Summary

## User Request

"I like the smaller deck when it's not drawing time but larger when cards are drawn. The idea is that playing area should be maximized during play."

## Solution

Implemented **dynamic deck sizing** for GameUIMinimal:
- **Small deck** during normal play (maximizes playing area)
- **Large deck** during draw phase (prominent and easy to click)
- **Smooth animated transition** between states

---

## Implementation Details

### **1. CSS Changes - Dual Size States**

**File:** `/opt/butterflyfx/dimensionsos/web/games/fasttrack/game_ui_minimal.js`

#### **Default (Small) Size - During Play**

```css
.cp-deck-icon {
    width: 32px;
    height: 42px;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;  /* Smooth size changes */
}
```

#### **Enlarged Size - During Draw Phase**

```css
.cp-deck-stack.draw-ready .cp-deck-icon {
    width: 48px;
    height: 64px;
    animation: deckPulse 1.5s ease-in-out infinite;
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.6);
}

@keyframes deckPulse {
    0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
    50% { transform: scale(1.05); }
}
```

#### **Responsive Sizing**

| Breakpoint | Small (Play) | Large (Draw) | Increase |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Desktop | 32×42px | 48×64px | +50% |
| Tablet (768-1024px) | 36×46px | 54×70px | +50% |
| Mobile (<768px) | 34×44px | 50×66px | +47% |

---

### **2. JavaScript Method - setDeckDrawReady()**

**File:** `/opt/butterflyfx/dimensionsos/web/games/fasttrack/game_ui_minimal.js`

```javascript
// Enable/disable draw-ready state (enlarges deck when it's time to draw)
setDeckDrawReady(ready) {
    const deckStack = document.getElementById('cp-deck');
    if (deckStack) {
        if (ready) {
            deckStack.classList.add('draw-ready');
            console.log('[GameUIMinimal] Deck enlarged - ready to draw');
        } else {
            deckStack.classList.remove('draw-ready');
            console.log('[GameUIMinimal] Deck minimized - playing area maximized');
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **3. Integration - Game Flow**

#### **A. Enlarge Deck - Draw Phase Starts**

**File:** `/opt/butterflyfx/dimensionsos/web/games/fasttrack/game_init.js`

```javascript
// When human player's turn begins (draw phase)
if (window.GameUIMinimal) {
    window.GameUIMinimal.setCurrentPlayer(player, playerIdx);
    // Enlarge deck when it's time to draw
    if (typeof window.GameUIMinimal.setDeckDrawReady === 'function') {
        log('Enlarging GameUIMinimal deck for draw phase');
        window.GameUIMinimal.setDeckDrawReady(true);  // ← ENLARGE
    }
}
```

#### **B. Minimize Deck - Play Phase Starts**

**File:** `/opt/butterflyfx/dimensionsos/web/games/fasttrack/board_3d.html`

```javascript
// After card is drawn (play phase begins)
if (window.GameUIMinimal) {
    // ... update drawn card display ...
    
    // Minimize deck after draw to maximize playing area
    if (typeof window.GameUIMinimal.setDeckDrawReady === 'function') {
        window.GameUIMinimal.setDeckDrawReady(false);  // ← MINIMIZE
    }
}
```

## Transition Animation

**Smooth 0.3s transition** between states:

```css
transition: all 0.3s ease;
```

**Effect:**
- Width/height change smoothly
- Glow fades in/out
- Pulsing starts/stops
- No jarring jumps

---

## Benefits

### **Before (Static Large Deck)**
- ❌ Deck always large (48×64px)
- ❌ Takes up space during play
- ❌ Reduces playing area
- ❌ Distracting when not needed

### **After (Dynamic Sizing)**
- ✅ Small deck during play (32×42px) - **maximizes playing area**
- ✅ Large deck during draw (48×64px) - **prominent and easy to click**
- ✅ Smooth animated transitions
- ✅ Pulsing + glow only when needed
- ✅ Best of both worlds

---

## Size Comparison

### **Playing Area Gained**

| Phase | Deck Size | Area Used | Playing Area |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Draw (Large) | 48×64px | 3,072px² | Reduced |
| Play (Small) | 32×42px | 1,344px² | **+1,728px² gained** |

**Result:** **56% more space** for board interaction during play phase

## Files Modified

1. **`game_ui_minimal.js`** (4 changes)
   - Reverted default deck size to 32×42px
   - Added `.draw-ready` CSS class styling
   - Added `deckPulse` animation
   - Added `setDeckDrawReady()` method

2. **`game_init.js`** (1 change)

3. **`board_3d.html`** (1 change)
   - Call `setDeckDrawReady(false)` when play phase starts

---

## Technical Details

### **State Management**

```javascript
// Draw phase starts
GameUIMinimal.setDeckDrawReady(true);
→ Adds 'draw-ready' class
→ CSS transitions to 48×64px
→ Pulsing animation starts
→ Glow effect appears

// Card drawn, play phase starts  
GameUIMinimal.setDeckDrawReady(false);
→ Removes 'draw-ready' class
→ CSS transitions to 32×42px
→ Pulsing animation stops
→ Glow effect fades
```

### **CSS Specificity**

```css
/* Base size (play phase) */
.cp-deck-icon { width: 32px; height: 42px; }

/* Override when draw-ready (draw phase) */
.cp-deck-stack.draw-ready .cp-deck-icon { width: 48px; height: 64px; }
```

Higher specificity ensures draw-ready state always takes precedence.
