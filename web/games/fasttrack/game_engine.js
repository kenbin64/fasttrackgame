 * MEANINGFUL HOLE NAMES & DEFINITIVE GAME RULES
 * ============================================================
 * 
 * HOLE TYPES (7 distinct types with meaningful names):
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 1. HOLDING HOLES (hold-{playerIdx}-{0-3}) - "Holding Area"
 *    CODE ID: hold-{playerIdx}-{0-3}
 *    COMMON NAME: Holding Area / Holding Holes
 *    COUNT: 4 per player
 *    PURPOSE: 
 *      - Starting position for 4 pegs (1 peg starts on Diamond)
 *      - Vanquished/cut pegs return here
 *      - Pegs waiting to enter play
 *    SAFETY: SAFE - Cannot be cut while in holding
 *    EXIT: Requires A, 6, or Joker to enter play via Diamond Hole
 * 
 * 2. DIAMOND HOLE / STARTING HOLE / WINNER HOLE (home-{playerIdx})
 *    CODE ID: home-{playerIdx}
 *    COMMON NAME: Diamond Hole / Starting Hole / Winner Hole
 *    VISUAL: Has diamond/square marker around it on board
 *    COUNT: 1 per player
 *    DUAL PURPOSE:
 *      a) STARTING: The 5th token begins game here. Entry point from holding.
 *      b) WINNING: The 5th token wins the game by landing here (after 4 are in safe zone)
 *    SAFETY: UNSAFE - Opponents can cut you here
 *    NOTES:
 *      - Own peg on diamond blocks other own pegs from passing (HOME BOUNDARY RULE)
 *      - This is NOT the Safe Zone Entry - that is a separate hole in front of Safe Zone
 *      - 5th token (after 4 in safe zone) goes LEFT from Safe Zone Entry to land here
 * 
 * 3. SAFE ZONE ENTRY HOLE (outer-{playerIdx}-2)
 *    CODE ID: outer-{playerIdx}-2
 *    COMMON NAME: Safe Zone Entry / Gateway to Safe Zone
 *    VISUAL: The hole directly in front of safe-{playerIdx}-1
 *    COUNT: 1 per player (specific outer track hole)
 *    PURPOSE:
 *      - The penultimate hole before entering the safe zone
 *      - ALL tokens must touch this hole (from left or right side) to count as
 *        having traversed the entire perimeter
 *      - Marks "circuit completion" - eligible for safe zone after passing here
 *    FLOW:
 *      - Tokens arrive via side-right track after exiting FastTrack
 *      - From here: Enter Safe Zone (holes 1-4) if eligible
 *      - 5th Token: After 4 pegs fill safe zone, passes Safe Zone Entry to the 
 *        LEFT and proceeds to Diamond/Winner Hole
 *    SAFETY: UNSAFE - Can be cut by opponents
 * 
 * 4. OUTER PERIMETER / TRACK HOLES
 *    A. SIDE-LEFT HOLES (side-left-{playerIdx}-{1-4})
 *       CODE ID: side-left-{playerIdx}-{1-4}
 *       COMMON NAME: Left Side Track
 *       COUNT: 4 per player section
 *       PURPOSE: Path from FastTrack Entry toward outer edge
 *       FLOW: side-left-1 → side-left-2 → side-left-3 → side-left-4 → outer track
 *    
 *    B. OUTER EDGE HOLES (outer-{playerIdx}-{0-3})
 *       CODE ID: outer-{playerIdx}-{0-3}
 *       COMMON NAME: Outer Track / Outer Edge
 *       COUNT: 4 per player section (along board edge)
 *       SPECIAL: outer-{playerIdx}-2 = SAFE ZONE ENTRY (see #3 above)
 *       PURPOSE: Main circular track around board perimeter
 *    
 *    C. SIDE-RIGHT HOLES (side-right-{playerIdx}-{1-4})
 *       CODE ID: side-right-{playerIdx}-{4-1}
 *       COMMON NAME: Right Side Track
 *       COUNT: 4 per player section
 *       PURPOSE: Path from FastTrack Exit toward Safe Zone Entry
 *       FLOW: FT Exit → side-right-4 → side-right-3 → side-right-2 → side-right-1 → Safe Zone Entry
 *    
 *    SAFETY: ALL UNSAFE - Pegs can be cut by opponents landing here
 *    MOVEMENT: Clockwise around board
 * 
 * 5. FASTTRACK HOLES (ft-{playerIdx}) - Inner Ring
 *    CODE ID: ft-{playerIdx}
 *    COUNT: 6 total (1 per player color, forming inner hexagon)
 * 
 *    A. FASTTRACK ENTRY HOLES (ft-{i} where i != playerIdx)
 *       COMMON NAME: FastTrack Entry / Hyperspace Entry
 *       PURPOSE: Shortcut entry points - any FT hole NOT matching player's color
 *       COUNT: 5 per player (all FT holes except own color)
 *       ENTRY: From side-left-{i}-4 of that section
 *       NOTES: Traversing FastTrack counts as completing a lap (hyperspace rule)
 * 
 *    B. FASTTRACK EXIT HOLE (ft-{playerIdx})
 *       COMMON NAME: FastTrack Exit / Player's Pentagon
 *       PURPOSE: Exit point from FastTrack to player's playing area
 *       VISUAL: Pentagon shape matching player's token color
 *       COUNT: 1 per player
 *       EXIT BEHAVIOR:
 *         - Default exit from FastTrack traversal to side-right track
 *         - Default exit from Bullseye (via J/Q/K)
 *         - If occupied by same color, exits to previous available FT hole
 *    
 *    SAFETY: UNSAFE - Pegs can be cut on FastTrack
 *    MOVEMENT: Clockwise around inner ring (ft-0 → ft-1 → ft-2 → ... → ft-5)
 * 
 * 6. BULLSEYE / CENTER HOLE (center)
 *    CODE ID: center
 *    COMMON NAME: Bullseye / Center / Dead Center
 *    COUNT: 1 (board center)
 *    LOCATION: Dead center of the board
 *    ENTRY CONDITIONS (2 ways to enter):
 *      a) PENULTIMATE: When ANY ft-* hole is second-to-last step of move
 *      b) BREAK ENTRY: On turn, sitting on ANY ft-* hole, use 1-card (J/Q/K)
 *    SAFETY: SAFE - Cannot be cut while in bullseye
 *    EXIT CONDITIONS:
 *      - ONLY with Royal cards (J, Q, K)
 *      - Exit destination: Own FastTrack Exit Hole (ft-{playerIdx})
 *    STRATEGY: Wait for perfect exit timing or cause traffic jam for opponents
 * 
 * 7. SAFE ZONE HOLES (safe-{playerIdx}-{1-4})
 *    CODE ID: safe-{playerIdx}-{1-4}
 *    COMMON NAME: Safe Zone / Protected Holes / Final Stretch
 *    COUNT: 4 per player
 *    PURPOSE: Final 4 protected holes before winning
 *    ENTRY: Via Safe Zone Entry hole (outer-{playerIdx}-2) after completing circuit
 *    SAFETY: SAFE - Cannot be cut in safe zone
 *    RESTRICTIONS:
 *      - OWNER ONLY: Only the owning player's pegs can enter
 *      - FORWARD ONLY: Can only move toward end, never backward
 *      - EXACT LANDING: Must land exactly to proceed (no overshooting)
 *    WIN CONDITION: Fill all 4 safe zone holes, then 5th peg bypasses safe zone
 *                   and lands on Diamond Hole to win
 * 
 * ============================================================
 * CARD BEHAVIORS
 * ============================================================
 * 
 * ENTRY CARDS (can bring peg from holding to home hole):
 * - Ace (A): Enter OR move 1 space clockwise. EXTRA TURN.
 * - Six (6): Enter with 0 moves OR move 6 spaces. EXTRA TURN.

 * 
 * ROYAL CARDS (can exit bullseye to FastTrack):
 * - Jack (J): Move 1 space. Exit bullseye allowed. EXTRA TURN.
 * - Queen (Q): Move 1 space. Exit bullseye allowed. EXTRA TURN.
 * - King (K): Move 1 space. Exit bullseye allowed. EXTRA TURN.
 * 
 * NUMBER CARDS (standard clockwise movement):
 * - Two (2): Move 2 spaces clockwise.
 * - Three (3): Move 3 spaces clockwise.
 * - Five (5): Move 5 spaces clockwise.
 * - Eight (8): Move 8 spaces clockwise.
 * - Nine (9): Move 9 spaces clockwise.
 * - Ten (10): Move 10 spaces clockwise.
 * 
 * SPECIAL CARDS:
 * - Four (4): Move 4 spaces BACKWARD (counter-clockwise).
 *   RESTRICTIONS: Cannot enter FastTrack, Bullseye, Safe Zone, or Home.
 * - Seven (7): Move 7 spaces OR split between 2 pegs (e.g., 3+4).
 *   Must use all 7 moves. No extra turn.
 * 
 * EXTRA TURN CARDS: A, 6, J, Q, K, Joker
 * 
 * ============================================================
 * MOVEMENT RULES
 * ============================================================
 * 
 * 1. DIRECTION: All movement is clockwise except 4 (backward).
 * 2. BLOCKING: Cannot pass or land on own peg.
 * 3. CUTTING: Landing on opponent's peg sends them to holding.
 * 4. CUT PREVENTION: If opponent has no room in holding (4 full + home occupied),
 *    the move that would cut them is BLOCKED and not legal.
 * 5. EXACT LANDING: Safe zone and home require exact count.
 * 6. CIRCUIT REQUIREMENT: Must pass home once before entering safe zone.
 * 
 * ============================================================
 * WIN CONDITION
 * ============================================================
 * 
 * Player wins when:
 * - 4 pegs occupy safe zone holes (safe-{idx}-1 through safe-{idx}-4)
 * - 5th peg has COMPLETED CIRCUIT and landed on home hole
 * - Circuit completion = peg traveled from home → around board → safe zone → home
