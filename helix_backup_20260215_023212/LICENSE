## Prior Art Declaration

This repository establishes **prior art** for the following concepts:

### Mathematical Kernel
1. **7-Level Helix State Machine** - State space H = {(s, l) | s ∈ Z, l ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}}
2. **Generative Manifold** - Mathematical surface that produces data types from geometry
3. **Token Materialization** - Lazy evaluation of values from geometric properties
4. **Dimensional Coordinates** - (spiral, level, position) addressing system

### Networking
5. **Helix Transport Protocol** - 7-level transport mapping to OSI model
6. **Manifold Server Protocol** - Transmitting math functions instead of raw data
7. **Audio Spiral Channels** - Per-musician dimensional audio channels

These concepts are hereby placed in the public record to prevent patent claims.
